We will accept only unique and new bugs. However, we’re trying to encourage all our security researchers who contribute to the project. We’ll be happy to hear your suggestions, wishes, and recommendations as well that will also be accounted and paid individually depending on their severity and value.

Severity of a bug will be evaluated by the dev team and the community.

### Depending on the severity of the problem there are following options of rewards:

1. **Remark or a minor issue:** from 50 to 150 LibreCash (Libre)

2. **Significant bug that affects core functionality**: from 150 to 750 LibreCash (Libre)

3. **Critical error**: from 500 to 1500 LibreCash (Libre)

In certain cases reward can be increased at the discretion of the project team.
